This bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` method sometimes returns incorrect values, particularly in certain edge cases.  For instance, on Android devices, if the device is rotated quickly multiple times, the values returned can be stale or inaccurate, leading to layout issues where components are mispositioned or clipped.

```javascript
//Incorrect Dimensions usage leading to layout issues
import { Dimensions, View, Text } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ width: width / 2, height: height / 2 }}>
      <Text>This component might be mis-sized</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```
